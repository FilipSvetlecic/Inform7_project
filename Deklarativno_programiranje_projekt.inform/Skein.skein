Two years. That&apos;s how long you&apos;ve been planning this escape. Every detail mapped out, every contingency considered. Tonight&apos;s the night. You will break this weak wall in your cell and find your way out. There are just a few more things that you need to do before your escape.

The items you need are scattered around the prison. Some you can find, others you&apos;ll need to trade for. Talk to the other prisoners and see what they want.

The cell door is open - you can move freely around the prison.


Here are the controls:
 examine &quot;something&quot; - examines the item and tells you the description
 talk to &quot;name&quot; - start a conversation with someone
 eat &quot;something&quot; - try to eat something
 steal &quot;something&quot; from &quot;someone&quot; - steal a thing from someone


These are the basic actions you can do.


You can find other functions that you can do by examining right objects.
 GOOD LUCK! 
The prison break

Cell
Your home for the past two years. Cold concrete walls surround you, with a rusty sink in the corner and a narrow bed. Behind the sink, you&apos;ve spent months secretly weakening a section of wall. The cell door leads north to the hallway.

An old stained sink with rusty pipes. Behind it, the wall looks suspiciously weak.

Your cellmate Dimitri lies on his bunk, reading.

You can also see a cell door, a hole and a narrow bed here.

Weight equipment and exercise machines fill this space. Prisoners come here to pass the time and stay strong. The hallway is to the west.

Viktor is doing pull-ups, his massive frame barely fitting in the space.

Dimitri is suspiciously lurking in front of your cell. He is onto something

You can also see a cell door here.

Garage
A space that stores lawnmovers, tree cutters and everything needed to keep the prison yard clean. This room is very close to the exit. As a matter of fact, the doors, your way out, are to the south. You can climb back into the vent.

You can see a slide and an exit door here.
